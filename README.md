# D3 TypeScript Template
This is a simple vanilla website template that uses D3.js and TypeScript. It is a good starting point for creating a D3.js project with TypeScript.
It also uses Vite as a build tool and SCSS for styling.

## Getting Started
1. Forking this repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies by either running `npm ci` or `yarn`
4. Start the development server by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

You are now ready to start building your D3.js project with TypeScript!

## Building for Production
To build the project for production, run `npm run build` or `yarn build`. The output will be in the `dist` folder.

## Boilerplate
This boilerplate gives a simple example of all the features of this template. You could just remove the files in the subfolders and clean up the `main.ts`.

## Alias
The `@` alias is set to the `src` folder. This makes it easier to import files from the `src` folder.
